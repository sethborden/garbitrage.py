garbitrage.py
=============

Tool for conducting currency arbitrage....something that you should NEVER do.

Script to pull data from a FOREX API and search for arbitrage paths to make a profit.

Do not do this, you'll loose money if you actually try and execute on this.  You don't have enough cash to make it worth the transaction costs, and even if you did you wouldn't do this in Python...too much lag.
